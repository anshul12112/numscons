	* 0.3.2 released
	* fix auto-adding of perflib options in meta lib checkers, which

	* 0.3.1 release
	* setupegg.py to build eggs

	* 0.2.3 release.

Thu, 17 Jan 2008 20:41:30 +0900

	* Remove all dependencies on numpy.distutils.

	* the perflib configurations are not put into a configuration file.
	This should enable more drastic simplification to the internals of
	perflib, which is way too complicated right now.

	* the compiler configurations are not put into configuration files,
	which are read by the functions get_f77_config and get_cc_config.

	* Starting to work on a separate numscons package, which will implement
	most of the functionalities of numpy.distutils.scons.
	* The package does not do much yet: incorporate last released scons-local
	+ some patches I've done for CheckDeclaration and CheckTypeSize, not yet
	incorporated upstream.
