	* Starting to work on a separate numscons package, which will implement
	most of the functionalities of numpy.distutils.scons.
	* The package does not do much yet: incorporate last released scons-local
	+ some patches I've done for CheckDeclaration and CheckTypeSize, not yet
	incorporated upstream.
