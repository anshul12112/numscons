	* GetNumpyEnvironment now returns NumpyEnvironment, a subclass of
	scons Environment. The long-term goal is to implement most code which
	makes cooperation with distutils into this class.

Thu, 06 Mar 2008 20:17:41 +0900
	* Do not use AppendUnique in save_set, because it is too fragile
	(imply reordering of some flags, e.g. libraries order, etc...).

Wed, 05 Mar 2008 23:23:58 +0900
	* 0.5.0 release
	* fix serious issue regarding build directories created outside the
	top directory of packages using numscons
	* fix an issue related to site.cfg customization for
	NumpyCheckLibAndHeader
	* various import fixes
	* NumpyGlob now internally uses scons Glob instead of glob.glob
	* Blas/Lapack checkers are refactored; all of them now use the same
	codepath

Sat, 01 Mar 2008 02:30:56 +0900
	* 0.4.2 release
	* source distribution fix: include .cfg files in MANIFEST.in

Tue, 19 Feb 2008 03:32:25 +0900
	* 0.4.1.1 release
	* Egg fix

Tue, 19 Feb 2008 03:32:25 +0900
	* 0.4.1 release
	* this relases main feature is support for MS compiler + g77 on
	windows. This means compiling scipy on windows with MS compiler is not
	that far anymore.

Thu, 14 Feb 2008 01:03:27 +0900
	* 0.4.0 release
	* this relases main feature is support for MS compiler on windows.

Mon, 28 Jan 2008 13:00:08 +0900
	* 0.3.4 release
	* this relases main feature is rewritten f77 link parser.

Sat, 26 Jan 2008 19:59:39 +0900
	* 0.3.3 release
	* Handle correctly f77 runtime support when needed in CheckLAPACK and
	CheckBLAS.
	* lapack config uses cblas config in BuildConfigFactory (fixes
	#186127).

Sat, 26 Jan 2008 15:56:38 +0900
	* 0.3.2 released
	* fix auto-adding of perflib options in meta lib checkers, which
	caused wrong order of linkflags, and link errors in x86_64.

Thu, 24 Jan 2008 22:03:18 +0900
	* 0.3.1 release
	* setupegg.py to build eggs
	* data_dir arg works with sdist

Thu, 24 Jan 2008 00:17:52 +0900
	* 0.3.0 release.
	* Sunperf checker works again on indiana
	* rpath is not used with Apple linkers
	* Do not throw exception when no customization is available for
	compilers, but uses a default set of values instead.

Wed, 23 Jan 2008 20:03:24 +0900
	* 0.2.3.1 release. This is a trivial fix to build numpy with numscons

Wed, 23 Jan 2008 17:43:14 +0900
	* 0.2.3 release.

Thu, 17 Jan 2008 20:41:30 +0900
	* Major revamp of numscons.checkers

Tue, 08 Jan 2008 00:12:11 +0900
	* 0.2.2 release: numpy can be built on linux with gcc.

Sun, 06 Jan 2008 21:43:15 +0900
	* 0.2.1 release

Sun, 06 Jan 2008 21:25:45 +0900
	* Remove all dependencies on numpy.distutils.

Sun, 30 Dec 2007 16:15:30 +0900
	* the perflib configurations are not put into a configuration file.
	This should enable more drastic simplification to the internals of
	perflib, which is way too complicated right now.

Wed, 26 Dec 2007 21:34:07 +0900
	* the compiler configurations are not put into configuration files,
	which are read by the functions get_f77_config and get_cc_config.

Sun, 23 Dec 2007 01:21:50 +0900

	* Starting to work on a separate numscons package, which will implement
	most of the functionalities of numpy.distutils.scons.
	* The package does not do much yet: incorporate last released scons-local
	+ some patches I've done for CheckDeclaration and CheckTypeSize, not yet
	incorporated upstream.
